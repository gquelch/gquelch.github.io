<p> I'm George Quelch and I work in Lighting and Compositing </p>

<p> I've worked across a broad range of styles from photoreal VFX, full CG to cartoony 2.5D. Being able to work artistically whilst finding creative solutions to technical problems strikes a great balance for me. Designing useful, flexible tools, that allow myself and others around me to work smarter, keeps me exploring new ideas and learning all the time. </p>
