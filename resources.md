<p> These are some of my favourite resources for Lighting and Comp Info as well as some other handy sites to know</p>

<br />

<h3>
	<a href="https://chrisbrejon.com/">CG Cinematography</a> by Chris Brejon </a>
</h3>

<p>A great resource for the concepts, techniques and execution of Lighting and Compositing, full of great information, well worth reading the entire thing. It's really inspired me to rethink my workflows, so I'm spending more of my time improving shots artistically, and using the computers time to push the lighting as far as it can go.</p>
